fixing some things to make original game better:

- scores show now in format: Score ("try again" / "wrong")
- you can use space to start the game, it will not go scroll the page
- removed header with useless links
- cookies replaced with local storage
- no annoying right click
- you can now reload page on ` button (its that button with ~ on it usually?) please suggest other button if this is bad
- somehow some silly images are now loaded instead of classic chess figures
